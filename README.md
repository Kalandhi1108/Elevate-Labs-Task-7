OBJECTIVE: Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

TOOL: Chrome

STEP 1- Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager

Chrome/Edge: Menu → Extensions → Manage Extensions

STEP 2- Review all installed extensions carefully

From My list:

1 )AdBlock – Common ad blocker, generally safe if from official source.

2) Free VPN for Chrome (VPN Proxy VeePN) – VPN extension, but check if it’s from a trusted provider; some free VPNs sell user data.

3) Google Docs Offline – Official Google extension, safe.

4) McAfee WebAdvisor – Security tool, official.

5) Turbo VPN – Secure Free VPN Proxy – Another VPN; running multiple VPN extensions isn’t necessary.

6) Wayin AI – Understanding Videos in Seconds – Less known, worth checking reviews.

7) YouTube To Text – Could be useful, but check privacy policy (it processes your video data).

STEP 3-Check permissions and reviews for each extension

For each extension, click Details → see “Permissions” section.

STEP 4- Identify any unused or suspicious extensions

STEP 5-Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions
From my list I remove Trubo VPN , Wayin AI, YouTube To Text

STEP 6-Restart browser and check for performance improvements

Restart after removal to see if pages load faster and memory usage drops.

STEP 7-Research how malicious extensions can harm users
Possible Risks:

-->Data theft (passwords, browsing history)

-->Ad injections and pop-ups

-->Redirecting to phishing sites

-->Slowing down your browser

STEP 8-Document steps taken and extensions removed
